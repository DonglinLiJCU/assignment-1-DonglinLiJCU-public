# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Reading Tracker
Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: Donglin Li

This repo contains starter files including a Python file anLd two CSV files.  
`books.csv` is a data file for you to use.  
`books_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used... it is here as a backup to copy the data from if you need it again.

This assignment I mainly use a list of lists to store the information of books. Ask user their choice by menu,
and then do the corresponding operation.


1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?
> 60 min


2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?
